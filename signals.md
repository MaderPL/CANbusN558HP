Engine: N55/N558HP (Bosch ME17.2 DME)  
Encoding: Little-endian (Intel byte order), ARM Cortex-M7 GCC bitfield-compatible

Signal extraction formula:
```python
def le_bits(data: bytes, start_bit: int, length: int) -> int:
    return (int.from_bytes(data, 'little') >> start_bit) & ((1 << length) - 1)
```

## Torque encoding (shared by 0x0A5, 0x0A6, 0x0A7)

All torque signals use unsigned 12-bit raw values with a common offset:

```
Nm = (raw_unsigned − 1999) / 2
raw_unsigned = Nm × 2 + 1999
```

Offset 1999 is derived from the idle constraint: `T_Act + T_Loss ≈ 0 Nm` at idle,  
giving `mean(T_Act_raw + T_Loss_raw) = 3998 → offset = 1999`.

| Raw value | Nm    | Meaning |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| 1999      | 0     | Zero torque |
| 2867      | 434   | Max engine torque (calibration ceiling) |
| 2097      | +49   | T_Act at idle (~650 RPM) |
| 1901      | −49   | T_Loss at idle (friction) |
| ~2200–2400 | 100–200 | Typical part-load to full-load range |

## Frame 0x0A5 — Engine Speed & Torque

Rate: ~100 Hz

| Signal          | Offset (bit) | Length (bit) | Scaling           | Unit | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|------|-------------|
| T1_Torque_Actual | 16         | 12           | Nm = (raw−1999)/2 | Nm   | Actual indicated engine torque. Matches A6 T_Act closely (r = 0.971). |
| T2_Torque_Setpoint | 28      | 12           | Nm = (raw−1999)/2 | Nm   | Rate-limited torque setpoint. Identical to T1 in 95.6% of frames; lags behind T1 during rapid transients. During torque-coordination interventions T2 can diverge widely from T1. |
| RPM             | 40          | 16           | rpm = raw × 0.25  | rpm  | Engine speed |

## Frame 0x0A6 — Torque Coordination

Rate: ~100 Hz

| Signal  | Offset (bit) | Length (bit) | Scaling           | Unit | Description |
|---------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|------|-------------|
| T_Loss  | 12          | 12           | Nm = (raw−1999)/2 | Nm   | Friction and pumping loss torque. Always negative. Minimum magnitude ≈ −17 Nm at 2000–3000 RPM; increases to −49 Nm at idle and −26 Nm at high RPM. |
| T_Max   | 24          | 12           | Nm = (raw−1999)/2 | Nm   | Maximum engine torque calibration limit. Constant at 434 Nm (raw 2867) during normal operation; reduces to ≈383 Nm at idle. |
| T_Cut   | 36          | 12           | Nm = (raw−1999)/2 | Nm   | Torque cut / limiter setpoint. Near 0 Nm at light load; rises to +40–50 Nm at high pedal during active torque coordination; negative values indicate active cut intervention. |
| T_Act   | 48          | 12           | Nm = (raw−1999)/2 | Nm   | Actual indicated engine torque. Primary torque output signal; equals A5 T1 (r = 0.971). |

### Representative Nm values

| Condition     | RPM  | T_Loss | T_Max | T_Cut | T_Act | Net shaft |
|--------------|------|--------|-------|-------|-------|-----------|
| Idle         | 660  | −49    | 383   | −2    | 49    | 0         |
| Light cruise | 2000 | −17    | 434   | +2    | 80    | 64        |
| WOT 3000 RPM | 3000 | −18    | 434   | +28   | 149   | 134       |
| 80% pedal    | 2600 | −23    | 434   | +44   | 185   | 163       |

Net shaft torque = T_Act + T_Loss (T_Loss is already negative).

### Friction model (T_Loss vs RPM)

| RPM range  | Mean T_Loss (Nm) |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 500–999   | −49             |
| 1000–1499 | −34             |
| 1500–1999 | −26             |
| 2000–2999 | −17             |
| 3000–3499 | −18             |
| 3500–3999 | −21             |
| 4000–4999 | −26             |

## Frame 0x0A7 — Torque & Unknown Signal

Rate: ~50 Hz  
Frame length: 7 bytes.

| Signal   | Offset (bit) | Length (bit) | Scaling           | Unit | Description |
|----------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|------|-------------|
| T_Demand | 12          | 12           | Nm = (raw−1999)/2 | Nm   | Driver demand torque (Fahrerwunschmoment). The raw pedal-derived torque request before coordinator limits are applied. Pearson r = 0.866 with pedal position. Runs 5–10 Nm above T_Act at mid-to-high load; lower than T_Act at idle (idle speed controller manages independently). |
| A7_Sig2  | 32          | 16           | TBD               | TBD  | 16-bit torque-related signal. Raw range observed: 31000–43242. At moderate cruise the value is close to T_Demand (O12 L12) within ~20–50 raw counts. At WOT/boost it significantly exceeds T_Demand and T_Act. Encoding and exact physical quantity not yet confirmed. |

### T_Demand vs T_Act comparison

| Pedal bin | T_Demand (Nm) | T_Act (Nm) | Δ (Nm) |
|-----------|--------------|------------|--------|
| 0–9%      | 6            | 12         | −6     |
| 40–49%    | 68           | 68         | 0      |
| 60–69%    | 127          | 124        | +3     |
| 80–89%    | 190          | 185        | +5     |
| 90–99%    | 171          | 166        | +5     |

At high load, T_Demand slightly exceeds T_Act — the driver requests slightly more than the coordinator delivers after applying T_Cut and T_Loss constraints.

## Frame 0x8F — Unknown Torque Signal

Rate: ~200 Hz (highest rate frame observed)  
Frame structure: 8 bytes. b0 = CRC/checksum (rapidly varying). b1 = alive counter (upper nibble fixed at 0x10, lower nibble cycles). b4–b7 = constant (0x22 0x00 0x20 0x10 — likely protocol/version bytes). Only b2–b3 carry live data.

| Signal   | Offset (bit) | Length (bit) | Scaling | Unit | Description |
|----------|-------------|--------------|---------|------|-------------|
| X8F_Sig1 | 16          | 16           | TBD     | TBD  | 16-bit torque-related signal. Raw range observed: 30800–36297. Correlates positively with engine load and torque. At moderate cruise, approximately tracks T_Act; at WOT/boost the value significantly exceeds T_Act. The RPM-dependent zero offset and the boost-related excursion suggest this is a different torque quantity than T_Act. Encoding and exact physical quantity not yet confirmed. |

### Observed X8F_Sig1 raw values

| Condition                  | Raw    | Notes |
|---------------------------|--------|-------|
| Key-on, engine off         | 32000  | Initialization default |
| Idle (~780 RPM)            | ~32000 | Near default |
| Light cruise (2000 RPM, 15% ped) | 31760–32000 | Tracks T_Act closely |
| Moderate load (2050 RPM, 23% ped) | 32300–32350 | Tracks T_Act closely |
| WOT 39% ped, 3300 RPM     | 33000–33850 | Significantly above T_Act |
| WOT 97.7% ped, 3000 RPM   | ~35200 | Further above T_Act |
| WOT 97.7% ped, 2000 RPM   | ~34050 | Above T_Act but less than 3000 RPM value |

The 0x8F signal is always smaller than A7_Sig2 (0x0A7 O32) at the same operating point. Both signals converge toward T_Act at moderate cruise and diverge increasingly at WOT/high boost.

## Frame 0x0A0 — Transmission Frame A (DME → TCU torque broadcast)

Rate: ~100 Hz

| Signal       | Offset (bit) | Length (bit) | Scaling            | Unit | Description |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|---------------------|------|-------------|
| Counter      | 0           | 16           | —                   | —    | Rolling message counter (16-bit LE, monotonically increasing). Not a sensor signal. |
| T_Coord      | 16          | 12           | Nm = (raw−1999)/2   | Nm   | Torque coordination signal broadcast from DME to TCU. Small range ≈ −7 to +0.5 Nm centered near 0 Nm. Slightly negative at cruise/WOT; briefly relaxes toward 0 during a shift event then returns negative. Exact role (shaft net trim or coordination headroom) unconfirmed. |
| TurbineSpeed | 48          | 16           | rpm = raw − 2000    | rpm  | Torque converter turbine shaft speed. At idle/stall: raw ≈ 2000 → 0 rpm. At lockup (engine ≈ 3300 rpm): raw ≈ 5300 → turbine ≈ 3300 rpm. Slip ratio = TurbineSpeed / EngineRPM rises from 0 (stall) to ≈ 0.98+ (lockup). Staircase pattern during WOT upshifts: turbine drops at each shift and recovers in the new gear ratio. |

### Turbine speed at key operating points

| Condition       | Engine RPM | Raw value | Turbine RPM | Slip ratio |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Idle / stall    | 650       | ~2000     | 0           | 0.00       |
| Light cruise    | 1500      | ~3100     | 1100        | 0.73       |
| 2nd gear WOT   | 3300      | ~5263     | 3263        | 0.99       |
| Lockup (cruise) | 2400      | ~4400     | 2400        | 1.00       |

## Frame 0x0B0 — Transmission Frame B (TCU → DME torque management)

Rate: ~100 Hz  
Direction: ZF 8HP45 TCU → Bosch ME17.2 DME

All torque signals use the same encoding as 0x0A5/0x0A6: `Nm = (raw − 1999) / 2`.

| Signal       | Offset (bit) | Length (bit) | Scaling           | Unit | Description |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|------|-------------|
| AliveCounter | 0           | 16           | —                 | —    | Rolling alive counter (bytes 0–1). Confirms frame is live. |
| B0_T1        | 12          | 12           | Nm = (raw−1999)/2 | Nm   | Torque signal. Saturated at 1048 Nm (raw = 4095, bytes 2–3 = 0xFF) during normal operation — effectively an "unlimited" flag. Exact role unconfirmed. |
| B0_ShiftCeil | 24          | 12           | Nm = (raw−1999)/2 | Nm   | **TCU shift torque ceiling.** Normally 1048 Nm (unlimited). During clutch-to-clutch upshifts, drops to 108–216 Nm for the duration of the overlap phase, limiting engine torque while the outgoing clutch releases and the incoming clutch engages. Returns to 1048 Nm at the instant T_Act spikes (clutch fully locked). This is the primary torque coordination signal from TCU to DME during gear changes. |
| B0_T3        | 36          | 12           | Nm = (raw−1999)/2 | Nm   | Torque signal. Ranges from ≈ 43 Nm at idle to ≈ 26 Nm at WOT; decreases with increasing engine load. Constant across shift events (not the shift ceiling). Exact role unconfirmed. |

### B0_ShiftCeil during WOT upshifts (example: t = 1197–1215 s)

| Shift event | Pre-shift RPM | Ceiling during shift | Duration | Post-shift T_Act spike |
|-------------|--------------|----------------------|----------|------------------------|
| 2→3         | ~3300        | ~216 Nm              | ~80 ms   | yes                    |
| 3→4         | ~3200        | ~108 Nm              | ~80 ms   | yes                    |
| 4→5         | ~3000        | ~108–162 Nm          | ~80 ms   | yes                    |

The DME's T_Cut on 0x0A6 mirrors the B0_ShiftCeil request: when the ceiling drops, T_Cut also drops by a corresponding amount, confirming this is a live torque-coordination handshake.
